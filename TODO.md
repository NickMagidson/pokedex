Pokedex

Styling is still in experimentation
  - Classic pokedex red
  - Future glassmorphism?
  - Background image



1. PokeCard Page
  - Body should have full height and no overflow
  - Fixed height and over flow for grid. Z-indexs
  - Add footer with enough room for searchbard
  - Convert Cards into framer motion divs


2. Autocomplete
  - Install Mui Autocomplete
  - Refactor SearchPokemon for that in lieu of Shad/Cn
  - Combine the card render and search into one page. Console.log the click for testing


3. Page per Pokemon
  - On Card click, route to another page of that specific pokemon


4. Filter cards by type
